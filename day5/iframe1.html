                        <p>Dosa, also known as Dosai in Tamil, is a popular and well-known South Indian breakfast or snack. A dosa is a thin pancake or crepe cooked from a fermented batter using lentils and rice as the main ingredients. Black gram lentils, husked and split, are used to make the dosa batter. Dosas are usually served hot with coconut chutney and sambar. The most common form of dosa is the plain dosa, which is essential and served with chutney and sambar. However, anyone looking for something different may choose from a variety of options, like masala dosa and rava dosa. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosa_(food)" target="wikipedia">see more</a></p>

                        <p>Pulao, also known as rice pilaf, is comfort food at its best. I make this Veg Pulao recipe when I want to cook something quick, easy and satisfying. This easy one-pot mildly flavored and fragrant vegetarian dish is bursting with deliciously spiced rice and vegetables, and is great on its own or paired with raita (an Indian yogurt dish), pickle and roasted papad (a crispy thin Indian snack).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulao" target="wikipedia">see more</a></p>
